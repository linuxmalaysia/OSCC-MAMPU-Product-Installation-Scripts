	# horde.org's recommended PHP settings:
	php_admin_flag safe_mode off
	php_admin_flag magic_quotes_runtime off
	php_flag session.use_trans_sid off
	php_flag session.auto_start off
	php_admin_flag file_uploads on
	# Optional - required for weather block in Horde to function
	#php_admin_flag allow_url_fopen on

	# If horde dies while trying to handle large email file attachments,
	#  you are probably hitting PHP's memory limit.  Raise that limit here,
	#  but use caution
	# Set to your preference - memory_limit should be at least 32M
	#  and be greater than the value set for post_max_size
	#php_value memory_limit 32M
	#php_value post_max_size 20M
	#php_value upload_max_filesize 10M

	# /usr/share/pear is needed for PEAR. /var/www/html/horde is needed for Horde itself
	# TODO: Set an appropriate include_path, too. Might even increase speed a bit.
